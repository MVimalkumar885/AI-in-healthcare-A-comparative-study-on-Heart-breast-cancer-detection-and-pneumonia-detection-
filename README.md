# AI-in-healthcare-A-comparative-study-on-Heart-breast-cancer-detection-and-pneumonia-detection-

ðŸ“– Overview

This project applies Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to machine learning models for diagnosing heart disease, breast cancer, and pneumonia.
The aim is to improve trust, interpretability, and transparency in healthcare AI systems.

ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies
Python 3.8 â€” Main programming language

TensorFlow 2.x â€” CNNs for pneumonia detection

XGBoost â€” Structured data models for heart and breast cancer

Explainability:

SHAP (global + local explanations)

LIME (instance-based explanations)

GradCAM (visual X-ray explanations)

Anchors (rule-based explanations)

Counterfactuals (what-if scenarios, DiCE)

CEM (contrastive explanations)

Platforms: Google Colab Pro, GitHub

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
